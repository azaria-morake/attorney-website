## ðŸš€ About This Project
- [**Prersonal Website**] : 

This a rudimentary personal website for legal practitioners/lawyers/attorneys.

It features 3 pages:

 - Home Page: 
   - The home page features a navbar that nests 2 other tabs: About and Consultations.
   - It also features a carousel, which content is arbitrary to the user but the borders will be fixed.
   - It also features more information that the user would love to have below the carousel.
   - May also include a footer, which at this point I don't find necessary for clogging up a visitor with superficial information.
 
 - About Page:
   - The about page will feature more information about the legal practioner. This is also an abitrary section and content is flexible as the attorney deems.
   - It may feature their accomplishments, practices, rates, etc.

 - Consultation Page:
   - The consultation page may provide a brief description about the services offered and a form that can be filled out and submitted.
